Readme
------

This package contains python modules to reproduce deep learning scientific papers.  
The general idea is to separate the dataset loading and pre-processing from the deep learning model implementation.  
The dataset implementation should be independent from the deep learning framework and the model implementation should be independent from the dataset.  
Initially this package will focus on image datasets and tensorflow models.
